# WordsWorth

A Wordle-like word puzzle game with resource management mechanics, built using Python and Tkinter.

## Game Overview

WordsWorth combines the popular word-guessing mechanics of Wordle with a resource management system. Players need to guess a 5-letter word while managing their coin economy.

### Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Guess the hidden 5-letter word within 6 attempts.
2. **Resource Management**: Players start with 10 coins (ðŸ’°) and spend them to guess letters.
   - Non-vowel letters cost 1 coin each
   - Vowels (A, E, I, O, U) cost 3 coins each
   - **Letters that have been guessed previously become FREE in subsequent guesses**
3. **Earnings**: When a guess is submitted, players earn:
   - 2 coins for each letter in the correct position (green)
   - 1 coin for each letter that's in the word but in the wrong position (yellow)
4. **Strategy**: Players can forfeit a turn to gain 7 coins, sacrificing one of their 6 attempts.
5. **Game End**: The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or uses all 6 attempts.

â”œâ”€â”€ wordle_game.py      # Game logic module
â”œâ”€â”€ word_list.py        # Word dictionary management
â”œâ”€â”€ resources/          # Directory containing word lists
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ five_letter_words.txt   # List of 5-letter words (created at runtime)

## Customizing the Game

You can modify the game's parameters by editing the following files:

- **wordle_game.py**: Change starting coins, costs, or rewards
- **word_list.py**: Modify word length or word source
- **gui.py**: Customize colors, fonts, or layout

## Technical Implementation

### Word Selection
The game uses a dictionary of 1,000 five-letter English words. It automatically downloads a word list from the internet or generates one if the download fails. The list is filtered to include only 5-letter words and stored in the `resources` directory.

### Game Logic
The core game logic is separated from the GUI, making it easier to modify or extend. The `WordleGame` class in `wordle_game.py` handles:
- Word selection and validation
- Guess evaluation
- Resource management
- Game state tracking

### User Interface
The GUI is built with Tkinter and features:
- A larger window (550x800) to ensure all letters fit properly
- A game board with spacious colored tiles
- An on-screen keyboard with standardized key sizes in QWERTY layout
- Coin emoji (ðŸ’°) displays instead of the word "coin" 
- Properly spaced elements to prevent overlapping
- Action buttons of equal size for a more uniform appearance
- A display of previously guessed (free) letters for easier tracking
